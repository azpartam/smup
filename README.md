About the project- thigs i would have done differently:
- enemies are already placed but are not updating until they are visible on camera( I would have preffered if they would activate when the player passes through a trigger)
- add more movement options for enemies.
- about the shooting in patterns: I was planning to isolate the shooting types from the enemy, and make a shooting pattern class. 
I would have also liked to give them different reload time.
- replace spawining of bullets with a bullet manager.
